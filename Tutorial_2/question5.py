# Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters, 
# and determines whether its parentheses, braces, and curly braces are "balanced." 
# Your program should read one line of input containing what is supposed to be a properly-formed 
# expression in algebra and tells whether it is in fact legal. The expression could have 
# several sets of grouping symbols of various kinds, () and [] and {}. 
# Your program needs to make sure that these grouping symbols match up properly.
